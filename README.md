POOLOTTO
 
No Loss staking based lottery Pool on BSC

June, 2021

Introduction:
POOLLOTTO platform is designed to provide a chance for everyone to participate in a lottery draw but unlike other lotteries, no one should spend even a single penny to get his lottery ticket.
Participants can take a part by staking their cryptocurrencies in POOLLOTTO platform to get their tickets and win big rewards which are collected from staking pools.
 
How it works?
1.	Users can stake $BNB and $CAKE in POOLLOTTO to receive LP-Tokens which will be their lottery ticket
2.	All rewards received from staked tokens will be collected by platform at end of each day to draw daily lottery winner (40% of daily rewards will be granted to 3 winners, 10% will be added to the platform reserve treasury and remained 50% will be added to the staking pool)
3.	At the end of week, there will be 2 lottery draws, one for daily reward like usual and one for weekly draw (those 50% remained from daily rewards plus compounded rewards will be granted to 10 lucky winners)


POOLLOTTO Token ($PLOT) use case:
$PLOT is required to be hold by every participant who wants to take part in lottery draw in platform and according to the number umber of their holding they will be benefited in the following ways:
1.	Users must hold at least 100 $PLOT in their connected address to be eligible for entering lottery draw
2.	There will be total supply of 10 billion $PLOT at initial price of 0.001 and those who hold at least 1 million $PLOT can also participate in platform’s voting pools.
3.	Users holding & staking at least 1000 $PLOT are considered as BASIC users (Tier.1) and accordingly there is 5 different Tier for users by number of $PLOT staked by users.
